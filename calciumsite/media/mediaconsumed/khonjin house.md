this shit really did like fuck up my entire vocabulary permanently. i recently put on some of the old episodes, and while a lot of them arent as funny to me now as they were in around 2017 when i watched them initially, there was still a lot of really standout moments. a lot of it is stuff that is so ingrained into who i am as a person oddly enough. im not going to lie, there are episodes of khonjin house that mentally outweigh the part of my brain that remembers the face of my mother. khonjin house exists in that same little vacuum of space that [[?homestuck]] does for me, where i can talk about it, and 95% of the time it just totally alienates everyone there, but in a way thats still funny to the uninitiated? hard to explain.

im not totally sure whats happening with khonjin himself behind the scenes anymore, but he was working on a game called supermental? it looked really interesting and i hope he gets to finish it someday since it seems like thats his true passion. a lot of the original run of khonjin house was tied to the lore of supermental. a slightly confusing lore, but a lore nonetheless. however most of that was cut out along the way in the many edits khonjin made to the series. im very torn on this, on one hand i like just having singular versions of things so i dont have to mentally compare and contrast every piece of media i partake in (i initially watched the directors cut of [[?handmaiden (2016)]] but apparently its not as good as the original cut? so i guess i have to watch it again). but at the same time ive come to understand khonjins want for a less muddy version of the show, and iirc the backlash to the edits was pretty overblown (cinematic parallels with [[?end of evangelion]] and all that?).

if you want the calcium approved criterion collection super cut of my personal favorite (objectively best) episodes of khonjin house this is probably pretty close:
- 3. mormon
- 7. winner
- literally anything ruther related 
	- 9. smash
	- 25. teacher
	- 57. cat part cat
	- 75. bowling
- 11. commercial
- 15. court
- 21. shark
- 29. disguise
- 31. road trip
- 33. spaghetti
- 34. dweebus (best episode, infinitely quotable, perfect timing)
- 39. girl
- 42. taxi
- 52. gay
- 61. dog
- 62. space
- 65. cry about it
- 70. the end (my art was in this one for like a fraction of a second)
