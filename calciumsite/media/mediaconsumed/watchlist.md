stuff i havent watched, or have forgotten, isnt backlinked in any other note, and im planning on watching. some entries here have notes on how i found them or what theyre mentally connected to for my own reference later when i inevitably forget. a lot of the time i just throw things into my watch list from a few screenshots or a rec so dont take this as me recommending all this shit. some things have multiple adaptations (ie manga and anime) and those will usually just get sorted into whatever catagory i intend to view them in.
there is also [[undocumented]] for stuff i have seen but havent talked about
