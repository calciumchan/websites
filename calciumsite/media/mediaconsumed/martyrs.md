i think about martyrs way more than most people probably should. its genuinely one of my favorite horror films of all time despite my not really enjoying the second half. 

the first half of this film is genuinely one of my biggest comforts in this horrid world. its just so insanely cozy and i really love just existing with these characters. i admit it is a little silly to kind of disregard half of a movie, but its hard to overstate the fact that i feel the film took a hard nosedive after the first half.

thats not to say the second half isnt worth watching. as far as gore films go, i think i might overall enjoy this more than [[?a serbian film]]. but that is to say that the first half just resonates with me more and the introduction of almost sci-fi elements kind of kills some of the connect i have if that makes sense.

many times since watching the film ive thought of readapting the first half in a fanfic to be a little more self contained. theres a pretty decent fade to black right about in the middle of the film that really does feel like a stopping point to me. with a few tweaks i really think that the entire film could have taken place within the house. i dont know maybe all this is really disrespectful, i just need people to realize how much i love the first half of this film.

im sure that i dont really need to tell you how cool some of the shit in this movie is. i feel like if i were to talk about the cool [[tom at the farm|xavier dolan]] opening or whatever it would just kind of feel like im shoving my finger at the screen and telling you how fucking epic something is like a child.

im a total sucker for a good horror film, and honestly this is about as good as they come in my opinion. its all so tense and really gave me a few good scares here and there. something about girls just being girls and getting into trouble is a lot of fun to me. [[?ginger snaps]] really comes to mind here. shoutouts to horror movies with weirdly cozy vibes. 

the mountains win again bitch. canadian filmmakers are undefeated. lets fucking go.
