this is a big catalog of media ive consumed in recent years. i tend to forget the things i watch pretty quick and its kinda MAKING ME MAD >:(

this wont catalog EVERYTHING ive ever seen, more so itll just be stuff ive consumed recently, or stuff that has realllly stuck with me and i feel like i remember enough to have something to say, mostly just for my own personal reference. the real end goal here is to have every "article" here interconnected with backlinks so you can start from one piece of media and just hop down backlinks without ever seeing the full list of media.

also worth note, most of the time that i talk about things here i kinda just assume everyone has already played/watched/read whatever it is. im kind of an absolutest when it comes to spoilers, and i personally would be pissed if i read anything on this page before partaking in the media myself so take that as you will, just know that pretty much everything here comes recommended from me, its rare that i talk about media i actively dislike (partially because i like almost everything i partake in) and i dont really like being super negative about any given piece of media.

this is all just goofy ass nonsense by the way, i just dont want to forget what ive seen.
