ive spent a bunch of time with RPGM2k3, at this point its probably become my favorite version of the engine. there are a lot of little things that annoy me about it, but theres enough to love that i can forgive it. obviously theres a hypothetical better version of this engine that could exist, but what we have is really special. despite being insanely old, the engine still holds up pretty well, its not a pain to get the games running (usually), and its visuals are so charming and easy to work with that its easy to see why so many people have gravitated towards it. with newer versions of the engine, its harder to make something visually pleasing in my opinion, theres a lot of tinkering that you have to do to make your game not feel like complete dog water. but here, things feel old, but in that charming "retro throwback" way, whatever that means.

the sprites and tiles in particular are a perfect size, its frustrating that you cant really make character sprites larger without a lot of hassle, but the size is so nice anyways that i dont really mind. in my own work its been a ton of fun to try and squeeze as much detail as possible out of the limited size and color palette. ive been using aseprite for all my graphics and its so simple and easy once you get the hang of it. i was very worried that converting the visuals to a special palette format would be a huge sticking point for me, but aseprite has made that process so much smoother and in my opinion the look is wonderfully old, especially when you stick to a single palette for all your assets, makes things very cohesive.

finding workarounds for the engines limitations is also really fun, it reminds me a lot of [[?gzdoom]] or my short time with [[?ZZT]] in that regard. my friend ivy has sent me tons of screenshots of their game [[?catjam]], and seeing something impressive built with a tool youre familiar with is even more impressive. being able to blow the lid off of engines like this and make something uncharacteristically cool is a lot of fun despite me kind of wishing i had more freedom at times.

the one thing i will gripe about is the combat engine, thats where i think the engine really gets slowed down, everything is so fixed in place it becomes infuriating. often times ive found myself having a really cool idea for something combat related and then being annoying when i spend a bit too long trying to find a clever way to accomplish it only to come to the realization that it just wasnt in the cards. this is kind of a gripe with most RPG makers one way or another though, even if you can edit the raw underlying code, the editor will never be flexible enough to really support what youre doing unfortunately. exploration games are really where this engine shines in my opinion, obvious [[?yume nikki]] and its many fan spinoffs come to mind, but a personal favorite is of course [[?toilet in wonderland]] which was made in RPG maker 2000 (the two engines are nearly identical tbh).

on that note, the games of RPGM2k3 are obviously the true draw. i want to briefly talk about a few of the more notable ones, and then give some watchlist picks im going to be keeping an eye on.

the aforementioned [[?yume nikki]] is probably the clear starting point, this is probably the engines biggest claim to fame, spawning countless fan games like [[?yume 2kki]] (possibly the best showcase of the engine?) and [[?.flow]]. 

the other previously mentioned game [[?toilet in wonderland]] is a game i hold in very high regard, im sure i dig deep enough into any of my work theres a little nugget of this game there.

[[?OFF]] is another popular example, being a game thats kind of taken on a life of its own in terms of fan content. this game is something really special and you can see its influence all over the place from [[?suits (game)]] to [[tess]].

speaking of [[tess]], [[?oneshot]] comes to mind as a groundbreaking subversive indie game. oneshot honestly takes its meta elements to much more "radical" places than something like [[?undertale]] or [[?doki doki literature club]] in so far as it tries as hard as it can to block you from playing it outright. that being said i think this was the first or second time i had heard of game game pulling something this meta (the [[?killswitch]] creepypasta and the ill fated [[?snatcher]] dick whiff disc thing come to mind).

[[?IB]] is a great example of a weird dinky little game growing far past its engine roots. just recently there was a real life gallery showing off some of the pixel art of the game, and if thats not the definition of winning i dont know what is. also something something i want to suck face with garry???

[[?space funeral]] in my opinion has had such a huge impact on the indie scene. it really does not give a single fuck, and we love it for that. i wouldnt be surprised if [[?crypt worlds]] took a lot of influence from space funeral and it only takes a cursory glance at itch to see that the amount of games with that space funeral swag is kind of insane. also sidenote i am obsessed with [[?space funeral 4]] and you cant stop me.

[[?mother cogdis]] is also absolutely wonderful, i want to see more oddball fan games like this in the future, RPGM2k3 fits the original mother style so perfectly and cogdis really shines as one of the better mother fan games (partially because its one of like 2 that are done, jesus christ this series is cursed).

beyond that, im very interested in checking out more games from this engine. [[?beloved rapture]] REALLY sticks out to me with its crazy visuals. [[?balmung cycle]], [[?blue memories]] and [[?paradise blue]] have some really interesting elements i want to dig into. [[?crypt of the fungal lord]] has some gorgeous sprite work i want to see more of. [[?friend hunt]] is super cute. ive heard a lot about [[?beautiful escape: dungeoneer]] and i think ill give it a shot at some point. [[?birthday kid (game)]] looks like it has that [[tess]] atmosphere i crave, always down for something like that. there are a couple of final fantasy fan games like [[?final fantasy: blackmoon prophecy]] and [[?final fantasy: time and again]] and i want to see what those are about, final fantasy fan games have a lot of potential in my opinion. speaking off fan games ive had my eye on [[?OFF]] fan games for a long time, [[?confinium]], [[?00_LR]], and [[?NEW (OFF fangame)]] (ivy reference omfg), and [[?HOME (game)]] are probably good starting points, but there are like a lot of these and i need to dive into a few of them at some point. there are way too many [[?yume nikki]] fan games im interested in for me to list, SO I WONT :).
