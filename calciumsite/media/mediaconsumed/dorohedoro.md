i am absolutely in love with dorohedoro. it really wasnt what i was expecting going in after having read [[?chainsaw man]]. i was geared for something a lot more dark and brooding than what i got from dorohedoro and honestly im pretty happy that i was wrong. the atmosphere and visuals of this book are grimey and cold but the characters and tone is anything but. for a lot of this mangas run it ends up feeling like a slice of life. it does pick up a bit in terms of action here and there, specifically at the start and near the end. but the entire mid point is characters messing about and being little goobers.

the cast is fantastic. theyre all set up really early on and watching them all grow and unveil their connections to each other is fascinating. there are characters that i expected to be taken out of the story relatively quickly like ebisu or chota, but despite how large the cast is, everyone feels fleshed out and has a lot of time to shine. you never really forget where a character is, which pays off wonderfully when you see paths coincidentally converging on each other. hayashida knows exactly where and when she wants her characters to be.

i really love how interconnected everyone is, and its great that we get to see so much of characters like the cross eyes. having so many different perspectives really lets you feel close to everyone and understand their individual struggles and motivations. i never feel like i dont understand why a character is doing something or why certain characters are add odds unless that ambiguity is intentional like with ai and his different incarnations. you really get attached to everyone in the cast and i ended up saving screenshots of hundreds of different panels that featured my favorite characters. any time natsuki, kasukabe and haru, ebisu, chota, or really any of the cross eyes were involved i was glued to each page soaking up that wonderful character development.

im really curious how much pre planning went into this because everything feels so tightly paced that i cant imagine not planning out everything well in advance. theres a lot of re contextualization going on throughout the series and at some point id love to reread it from the start since im sure there was even more set ups i didnt really pick up on here and there. the healing brain implants paying off in the most unexpected way,caimans pickled head being brought up like 6 times, literally anything related to risu and aikawa, there are so many plot threads and most of them tie up and intersect beautifully.

the way hayashida teases the reader with mysteries is aggravating in the best way possible, especially early on. it really pushed me to keep reading and i always felt like i was getting little hits of explanation before quickly moving past it to open another door. characters like chota and chidaruma will start explaining something before getting distracted or forcefully pulled away from the conversation. im fine with exposition if it comes naturally like this and in such small micro dosing bursts. the film that chota shows to nikaido is perfect, it sets up ens hatred of the cross eyes perfectly but leaves that sense that en is exaggerating for the sake of the film hanging in the air.

i am a little disappointed that the anime adaptation isnt anything special. im glad that it seems to have sparked so much interest in this story but aside from that there isnt a whole lot i can say about it. looking at in comparison to the manga, everything needed a few more layers of grime to it. the 3d models are really flat in terms of color and shading, and it feels like a really missed opportunity. one of the benefits of 3d models over 2d animation is that its a lot cheaper to give everything lots of detail. you dont have to draw all the extra grime 12 times a second, you can just apply extra textures and shaders onto your models. why wasnt there a shader on these models to give them that distinctive rough look a lot of hayashidas art has? the series is titled "mud and sludge" so where is it?

mappa is such a middle of the road studio, they seem to take on a lot of these more adult grittier properties, but they clearly just cant support it with their insanely strict schedules and habit of overworking staff members. i do really wish that adaptations werent such a huge thing in anime in general, it forces a story that was made in a very specific medium and under very specific restrictions into a totally different world and it just doesnt seem to work. it means that a studio like mappa cant just make something based around what resources they have available and instead they have to stick to whatever a mangaka wrote in a few months while living on ramen noodles and ibuprofen. something original just set in the world of whatever it is you have the license to can be so much more interesting and be made better within the limitations your studio has. i feel like in a lot of cases that would be better than tying up licenses like this and pushing out subpar products from the ground of amazing works. its one thing when a flavor of the week light novel gets a forgettable adaptation, its another when a 18 year long passion project gets the same.

something something dorohedoro moodboard fuck off
