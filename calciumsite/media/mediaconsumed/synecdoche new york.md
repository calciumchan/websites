ive seen this film twice now. every time ive seen it ive walked away with something slightly different. i can honestly say this film has shaped me greatly from the two active interactions ive had with it, and given the nature of the film i plan on revisiting every few years. 

it didnt hit me as hard on the first viewing, im not sure why. i remember walking away from it really enjoying it, but i guess i just wasnt in the right head space at the time, between my first and second viewing a lot changed in my life, i lost a lot of friendships i had once held dear, i undertook some sweeping personal life changes i at one point thought i would never undergo. my second viewing was a lot more introspective than my first and i hope that continues to be the case as i rewatch the film over the course of my life. 

on this latest viewing, one of the things that really stuck out to me was the strange amount of queerness. from the little bit of digging ive done on the film (reading reviews and such) its almost never talked about. i had pretty well forgotten all about it between my two viewings. but its like, there? like its REALLY there. it kinda fakes you out with a few throwaway lines (if you can really call any dialog in a film like this "throwaway"), and some subtle theming in relation to caden and ellen. but it gets super overt and kind of heart wrenching at times? i want to know what kaufman was cooking so bad but i LITERALLY CANT HOLY SHIT.

also i want to kiss charlie kaufman on his silly little noggin for the "its everything" line. mf really knows how to capture that "i am talking to someone who will never understand what im trying to say" feeling perfectly and i hate it and i love it.
