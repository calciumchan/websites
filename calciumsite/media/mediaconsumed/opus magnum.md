ive recently been playing opus magnum. i dont play many games, but this one has caught my eye for so long, and patty taxxon was posting about it a lot on tumblr so HERE I AM 5 hours deep. im still in the early game, but its one of the most rewarding experiences ive had with a game in a long time. afaik this is my first zachtronics game and if opus magnum is anything to go off of ill be checking out the rest of their lineup in the future. so far in my play time there hasnt been a level i havent played, then IMMEDIATELY replayed at least once. by the time you solve a puzzle your brain is already working on a better solution, and spreading the completion statistics over 3 criteria makes this game truly something special.

the design is fast, but can i make is smaller? or cost less? the end of puzzle stats screen where it shows you how your design stacks up against everyone elses is really fascinating and a huge drive to try and push your design just that little bit further. and whoever came up with the idea to include the option to save a gif of your solution deserves all the raises, im sure the handful of friends i excitedly dump a few gifs on each time i play the game might disagree, but its wonderful to have a little collection of gifs, and be able to post them anywhere with ease. its part of the reason i finally pulled the trigger on plunging into the game in the first place. im genuinely a little surprised to find that there isnt some kind of booru for this game, maybe its just not worth it but it would be a wonderful sight to see.

knowing me theres a good chance i drop the game after at this point, i havent been able to play it in a few days and that usually means that its kinda just over at that point, but something tells me this will be different. im not at the point of the game where solutions take hours and hours so maybe itll get dropped then, but for now its easy enough to just pick up, do a solution and move on with work.

its honestly really nice that this game can be played in such small bursts so easily, i love games like [[?factorio]], modded automation [[?minecraft]], stuff like that, but for the most part they all end up sucking away so much of my time that i kind of have to force myself to not play them at all, [[?mindustry]] probably being the biggest exception up until now since its a lot more focused on its tower defense aspect, but it still takes a long time to finish a match once you know what youre doing. so shoutouts to opus magnum being a mini factory builder puzzler.

though that does make me kind of long for a larger factorio like experience but with the tools of opus magnum, i wonder how large the late game and the workshop content can get because having something huge and interconnected can be really satisfying. something like factorio, but you have to program the internals of your assembly machines would be insane, the cost:size:speed ratio would make a much larger impact on actual gameplay. there was an old minecraft mod that involved fully programmable lua computers? that was kind of similar i suppose.
