this is a list of all the mystery dungeon games im able to scrounge up. its difficult to find an exhaustive list of all mystery dungeon styled games for a variety of reasons, namely pokemon MD taking up a lot of search results, and "mystery dungeon" referring to both a style of game, and an official series of games by spike chunsoft. 

mystery dungeon works in a very similar way to the "warriors" games ([[?dynasty warriors]]), where its a style of game mostly developed by koei tecmo with lots of different IPs like [[?dynasty warriors: gundam]] or [[?hyrule warriors]], but there are also games that fit into the "warriors" genre on some level like [[?drakengard]].

for obvious reasons this kinda sucks mad shit on a lot of different levels, and when trying to find all the mystery dungeon styled games like [[?digimon world 2]] or [[?izuna]] you end up getting hit with lists of only the chunsoft titles if youre lucky, or just the pokemon titles if youre unlucky.

a couple notes for this list. i wont be highlighting mobile games since i dont intend on playing them for the most part, but they will be listed. a lot of this info is coming from wikipedia lists and reddit posts, sorry in advance for any quirks that come from that. im playing a little loose with the definition of a mystery dungeon game, but you kinda know one when you see one ig. also this list is mostly for my personal use. but if ive made any mistakes or omissions please get in contact with me somehow.

anyways heres a list of games in the mystery dungeon genre, and not just the series.

a couple things of note about the chunsoft titles:

first off, twinbee mystery dungeon is a wild fucking concept and im pissed it was released on mobile in the year 2004, fuck my life. hopefully theres a way to play it, it looks so fucking cute.
im a little surprised there wasnt a [[?made in abyss]] mystery dungeon game released, spike chunsoft had the rights to MIA for [[?made in abyss binary star falling into darkness]] and id love to see it ngl.
its still surprising to me that the first mystery dungeon was a dragon quest spin off.
also i dont think squeenix ever used the "final fantasy fables" tag line past the third chocobo game and one other DS chocobo game afaik, very odd. i want more chocobo games god damn.

# SOME NOTES ON MYSTERY DUNGEON GAMES

2023-11-28
its very interesting to me that no matter who makes these games, they usually stick pretty closely to the formulas set in the first toreneko game. the way floors are generated are practically identical. which is really weird to me? we live in an age where everone and their mom lost their shit over the [[?spelunky classic]] mixes random and hand made elements together. and here we are using boxy rooms and corridors. im not saying its bad, i dont really mind. but i think theres a lot of room for growth in the formula overall and all thats really needed is one indie dev whos played way too many [[?pokemon mystry dungeon: explorers of sky]] mods to come along and revolutionize the formula forever. (something something [[?crypt of the necrodancer]]???)
