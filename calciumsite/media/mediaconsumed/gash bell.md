its finally done, what a fucking ride honestly. its rare that i dip back into pure shonen territory. when it comes to manga im pretty firmly in the seinen camp for the most part. [[dorohedoro]], [[?chainsaw man]], and [[inside mari]] are pretty recent examples of things ive read that ive loved. and it was kind of nice in some ways to ping something a little more light hearted.

i have pretty mixed feelings about a lot of gash bell, specifically the faudo arc and some of how the ending is handled kind of get under my skin. but i dont really want to focus on that here to be honest. im living in a real post [[?chainsaw man]] world here. im just not used to really long arcs anymore like when i was a kid, i like when things hit fast and hard. so for the sake of being positive about a thing i liked, i want to focus on what gash bell does well. and to be fair theres a lot of things it does well.

i really really love that gash bell doesnt forget about its characters. one of the biggest gripes i had with [[?shaman king]] when i reread it a few years ago was how main, in the party ass characters just disappear. faust is my favorite character and he just gets shoved into the back of the party line and is basically just a healer. gash bells cast is probably on par with shaman kings to be honest, but it feels so much wider because characters just stick around longer. there are tons that only show up when needed like apollo, and arguably riddle professor after the millennium demon arc. but as long as you are an active participant in the events happening on screen, you are THERE.

id argue that sunbeam is probably the least involved of all the main cast, but even he feels really present a lot of the time. by the end of the series i really felt attached to these little blorbos. and despite the series not having much in the way of actual stakes, no ones actually in any real threat of dying, i still found myself really emotional over characters like wonrei and tio. the whole last arc kind of got to me. say what you will about clear notes introduction, but i feel like not really focusing on him was the way to go, those last handful of chapters that really just focus on our main cast were really fun to me.

on that note, i really wish that clear note was handled a little better. hes easy to love with how menacing he comes across. im not the biggest fan of his later forms, but for for a few chapters theres really something special there i think. it did its best to build a climax for itself and i think it worked out about as well as it could have given the lack of lead up. maybe im just a stickler though.

i really looked forward to those small character interactions that we got sprinkled throughout. battles are fine and all, but especially during faudo, i want them to be like, a handful of pages here and there. let me get more of characters like cherish or even suzume. the reason i care so much about a character like wonrei "dying" is because ive grown to love not just him, but the relationships hes fostered with the rest of the cast. i feel like the fights are just there because they have to be, and honestly sometimes they really just drag things down.

that last kyanchome arc was amazing. i started out kind of dreading kyanchome whenever hed show up, but i really grew to love him and folgore. by the time his little character study chapters rolled around i was so ready. they hit extra hard for me after watching him grow. it really felt like a natural evolution of his character, suddenly getting burdened with immense power that ends up corrupting him. it was all so wonderful.

i really like the battle with zeon. it felt really cathartic and real. i ended up watching the fight in the anime and it just doesnt hit the same. zeon and dufaux coming to a remorseful realization just feels right. theres a lot of parts of the faudo arc that i really love. stuff like the fight with zeon, or anything to do with barry really, really makes me wish that the rest of the arc didnt drag so much. that shot of cherish with all the hands stabilizing her shot was beautiful. i loved it a lot. 

a lot of my thoughts here are probably a bit scatterbrained similar to my [[dorohedoro]] post, i dont take notes for most of the manga i read like i often do with movies and shows. jotting down a note is kind of cumbersome since i typically read on my lunch breaks at work. and for longer series like gash i kind of end up forgetting a lot of things so my thoughts are pretty heavily biased towards the end of the series. but the early parts of the manga are kind of a trip to be honest.

the pacing in the early portions, probably pre faudo, id say even pre millennium demon, is really breezy. there are a couple fights that kind of drag, but honestly i could have gone for a lot of just smaller storylines throughout instead of lumping a lot of the story into 2 large conflicts. 

dannys little story is really nice. hes pretty unique among other demons, and his relationship with his partner feels pretty special. at some point a lot of the demons partners kind of become set dressing, theyre just there because they have to be. but "mr goldo" (tthats his fucking name???) is a really nice pairing with danny. i really felt like these two characters cared about each other despite how little they were in the story. the one real draw back with the quick pacing is that you dont really get time to get attached to some of these characters the same way you might have if they were in a little more of the story.

koruru is a character i really love. im a bit of a crybaby i will admit, but her handful of chapters made me cry more than they probably should have. she does get brought up again and again in kind of a [[?full metal alchemist]] dog girl kind of way. but i still would have loved for her little b-plot to have gone on a bit longer.

leila might get the shortest end of the stick in this regard. shes kind of just taken out of the plot for no real reason. i would have loved to have spent more time with her. there are a few time where it would have been totally fine to let the character stick around and just slip into the background and pop their head in every now and then. i dont know maybe this was a more graceful way to go. but i would have killed for even like one chapter where kiyomaro takes this poor fucking child to mcdonalds or something before burning her book. interacting with characters outside of conflict situations feels a lot different, and in the case of leila i feel like theres a lot of unresolved baggage with her partner. idk write a fucking fanfic about it bitch jesus christ.

the small arc with gash grappling with his demonhood was really nice. i dont recall it being brought up again directly unfortunately. but its a nice little addition that you dont really see in shonen series. characters deal with their overwhelming and potentially alienating power is a lot of fun to me. i love examining things like that. its handled pretty well here and i feel like it really adds to gashs character. he squares off with a lot of other demons that have given in to their demon nature so to speak, and its really heartwarming to think that gash sees a little bit of himself in the series antagonists.

i think overall my favorite side character might be patty. just like kyanchome, i kind of fucking hated her for the first few chapters after she was introduced. that might just be intentional to be honest. these are literal actual children, and it takes a little while for a kid to grow into being respectable if that makes sense. im really surprised i ended up liking her as much as i did, and maybe its just a case of me being a real sucker for heroic sacrifice. but i found myself missing her way more than i could have ever expected. same with leila to a degree, but something about patty was really compelling. getting a decent chunk of time to get acquainted with her probably helped a lot. her character arc is a bit of a slow burn, but thats probably for the best.

as for extra material i might look into, im kind of curious about the sequel series, though thats still very much on going and its hard for me to keep up with manga like that. the animes kind of a no go for me, im really not a fan of how it looks, but thats just kind of how it is and nothing unique to this series. the movies howeever are really interesting to me. im a big fan of stuff like the [[?full metal alchemist]] films, where it doesnt really tie into anything else and can kind of just stand as a new perspective within an established set of characteristics. the games are something ive had a hankering for for a little bit. the video games look hella jank in the best way possible. and the card game has some crazy ideas that dont really work properly, but are super insanely interesting nonetheless.

gash bell is a very weird series. i feel like its often overlooked, and to me thats kind of criminal. i surely didnt enjoy it as much as a younger version of myself would have. or perhaps its not a matter of how much i enjoyed it being different, so much as it is a matter of the way i enjoyed it being different. theres a lot to love here, and it has a lot of heart. if nothing else, its a really good example of writing very unique, and relatively fleshed out characters. this is probably my golden standard for its particular brand of shonen if that makes sense. something like [[?full metal alchemist]] is probably just the bar of quality for shonen, but its aiming for a much different demographic if that makes sense. in terms of those purely light hearted series, gash bell is a pretty strong contender overall if you ask me.

okay i have no idea how i forgot about this while i was writing, but i really really want to mention it because i think its fucking hilarious.

![[Pasted image 20240306134236.png]]

so i consume most of my media from unofficial sources. so fan translations of manga and anime are pretty common for me. one side effect of that is that fan translated manga are often a lot more crass than official translations. it ends up being a situation where i can never really tell if what im reading is meant to be as blunt as it is. characters in gash bell will just say fuck. which is interesting because like, is this just a normal thing for kid centric media in japan? or is it just a translator 1:1 translating something without a care to how a word is treated in japan vs in north america? like how much weight is put on a word like "kuso" in japan. i remember the word "fuck" being a forbidden word when i was growing up, and it certainly would have never shown up in the media i was allowed to consumed as a kid. its hard to tell.

anyways, this is probably one of the wildest translator notes ive seen to date. this was probably a lot more common back in the day, but just seeing someone blatantly shove their weird little political take into their fucking manga translation of all things. its bizarre and really caught me off guard. at the very least i will give them props for leaving it as a translator note and still presumably translating the line.

it really reminded me of that weird dragon maid controversy from a few years ago. im sure most people dont remember this at all because who the fuck would? but a lot of people took issue with the kobayashi dub heavily altering a line. i remember people claiming it was some egregious act, something something SJW, something something feminism. i dont remember all the details, this was like almost a decade ago at this point. but its kind of silly in hindsight.

i feel like translating is one of those things that we often just think about as having some objectively correct and incorrect way of being done. but really its a creative field just like any other. its kind of impossible to 1:1 translate something, like the fact that the bible has been translated like a million times should be proof of that. if you really want the full experience of a work you kinda just have to learn the language. i dont know, i feel like its just good that these things get translations at all. youre never going to please everyone and any criticism of a translation really just boils down to personal preference. imagine getting pissy at the fucking ghost stories dub yknow?
